# Bitcoin Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project explores using machine learning to predict Bitcoin prices using historical data from Yahoo Finance. The goal is to build a model that helps understand how Bitcoin prices move, assisting in making smarter investment decisions in the cryptocurrency market.

## Approach

1. **Data Collection and Preparation**: We gather and clean historical Bitcoin price data, ensuring it is ready for analysis.
2. **Creating Features**: We employ a technique that analyzes past Bitcoin price patterns to predict future prices.
3. **Building the Model**: Initially, we use a simple method called Linear Regression to predict future Bitcoin prices based on the identified patterns.
4. **Model Evaluation**: We test the model's predictive accuracy by considering how the data evolves over time.
5. **Results**: Our model demonstrates potential in estimating Bitcoin price movements. Visual comparisons of predicted versus actual prices showcase the model's understanding of market trends.

## Findings and Future Work

Our findings suggest that machine learning can aid in predicting Bitcoin prices, providing valuable insights into the cryptocurrency market. To enhance the model, we plan to:

- Experiment with more advanced algorithms
- Explore different data features
- Implement additional evaluation metrics to measure model accuracy

This project aims to provide a better understanding of Bitcoin's market behavior and lays the groundwork for using machine learning to forecast prices, offering opportunities for improved investment strategies.
